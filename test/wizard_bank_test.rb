  # REALLY Hard Mode:
  # Make it so a person can have accounts with multiple banks and is able
  # to transfer money from one to the other and vice versa.
  # Remember to write happy and sad path tests.
  # Think about edge cases - and things bad people would try to do.
  # People shouldn't try to transfer more money than they have, etc.
  # Hint: Consider using hashes to store what banks a person has accounts at
  # and their respective balances.
  #
  # Be aware that if you decide to start using a hash to store banks and
  # balances, it will cause you to rewrite a lot of code and some previous
  # tests WILL break. Rewrite tests to cover and take into account this
  # functionality.
